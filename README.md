# Neural-Network-Implementation
Step By Step Implementation of Neural Network in Python. I have used Back Propagation Algorithm
to minimize the errors and train the neural net .

I have added 2 files :

1. single_layer_neural_network ( First go through this as it is easy to understand.It
   has only a single layer with just input and output states without any hidden layers ) 
   
2. multi_layer_neural_network  ( It is a multi-layer implementation with input , hidden and output layers. In 
   this case we have 2 hidden layers one of 5 nodes and another of 4 nodes)
   
Anyone who understands the basics of neural network and back propagation can easily flow through the code. Its
self explanatory.
